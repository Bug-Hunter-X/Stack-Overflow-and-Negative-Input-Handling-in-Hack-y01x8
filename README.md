# Hack Code Bug: Stack Overflow and Negative Input Handling

This repository demonstrates a potential stack overflow error and incorrect negative input handling in a simple Hack program.  The `foo` function calculates factorials recursively, which can lead to a stack overflow for large inputs.  The `bar` function does not handle negative inputs appropriately. 

The `bug.hack` file contains the buggy code.  The `bugSolution.hack` file provides a corrected version that addresses the stack overflow and negative input issues.
